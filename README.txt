== Description ==
This plugin allows a user to insert a Vuelio Canvas into their WYSIWYG editor or in their widgets e.g. sidebar 
and it will render on the front end of the website.

The Canvas is an application that runs on the media company Vuelio's infrastructure. This plugin essentially hosts a view of a chosen Canvas via an iframe in the users blog.

The iframe when selected is set to be fully responsive.

Ways to use

1. You can use the plugin in your editor. Once activated an 'Insert Vuelio Canvas' button will appear above the WYSIWYG. Click on this and paste in your canvas address and the plugin will create an iframe with your chosen source.

2. In your administrative navigation under 'appearance' -> 'widgets',  you can drag the 'Canvas Widget' into a content panel. Once added you can add the url of your canvas. This becomes your global canas widget URL and this will insert an iframe with this value as the source.


What is the Vulio Canvas

The Vuelio Canvas allows you to quickly collate all the news, videos and social activity relevant to you in a visual, easy to use hub. Details on signing up can be found here http://email.vuelio.com/vuelio-canvas-free-demo-nov

If you don't have ownership of a newsroom you can still insert your favourite newsrooms from around the web using this plugin.


Note: There is no obligation to use a URL that is of the order https://canvas.vuelio.co.uk. You can in fact enter the url of any website you like and we render a responsive iframe!
